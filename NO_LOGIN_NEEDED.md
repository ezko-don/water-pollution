## ⚠️ **About the "Sign In Failed" Error**

### **Why It Happens:**
- The original app was designed with authentication
- It tries to connect to Supabase (a backend service)
- You don't have Supabase configured, so it shows "failed to fetch"

### **Does It Matter?**
**NO!** For your multimedia presentation, you don't need:
- ❌ User accounts
- ❌ Database storage
- ❌ Authentication system

### **What Still Works:**
- ✅ **All multimedia features** (video, audio, animations)
- ✅ **All interactions** (sliders, toggles, forms)
- ✅ **All pages** (Home, Problem, Pledge)
- ✅ **All demonstrations** for your class

## ✅ **What to Tell Your Professor**

> "This is a frontend multimedia demonstration. The site was originally designed with a backend authentication system (Supabase), but for this presentation, I'm focusing on the multimedia features - HTML5 video/audio, SVG animations, Web Audio API, and interactive elements. All the multimedia functionality works perfectly without authentication."
